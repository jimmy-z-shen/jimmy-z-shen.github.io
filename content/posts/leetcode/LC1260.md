## 1260. Shift 2D Grid

[LC1260](https://leetcode.com/problems/shift-2d-grid/)

Not really focusing on any algorithm or structure.

The idea is to:
1. convert the 2D Grid into 1D array
2. Make the shift k % (row * col)
3. Convert 1D array back to 2D Grid

```python
class Solution:
    def shiftGrid(self, grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        row = len(grid)
        col = len(grid[0])
        k = k % (row * col)
        arr = []
        for each_row in grid:
            arr.extend(each_row)
        arr = arr[-k:] + arr[:-k]
        for i in range(row):
            for j in range(col):
                grid[i][j] = arr[i * col + j]
        return grid
```
