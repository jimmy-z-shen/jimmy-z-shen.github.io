## 636. Exclusive Time of Functions

[LC636](https://leetcode.com/problems/exclusive-time-of-functions/)

When using stack, be careful for 3 things:

1. what element to store in the stack
2. condition to push onto stack
3. condition to pop out of stack

Think of stack as a method to preserve a state for later use.
Since we want to calculate the execution timing of a function.
When we get a log saying a function has started, we need
to preserve the state, stores \[process_id\] and \[start_time\].
So later, we can use it to calculate the timing when there's an inner
function starts or the current function ends.

Here's the solution

```python
class Solution:
    def exclusiveTime(self, n: int, logs: List[str]) -> List[int]:
        result = [0] * n
        stack = []
        for log in logs:
            tokens = log.split(":")
            i, state, time = int(tokens[0]), tokens[1], int(tokens[2])
            if state == "start":
                if len(stack) > 0:
                    result[stack[-1][0]] += (time - stack[-1][1])
                stack.append([i, time])
            else:
                result[i] += (time - stack[-1][1] + 1)
                stack.pop()
                if len(stack) > 0:
                    stack[-1][1] = time + 1
        return result
```

### Complexity
- number of `logs` is m
- Time Complexity: O(m)
- Space Complexity: O(m)
