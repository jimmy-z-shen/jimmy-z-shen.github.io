## 792. Number of Matching Subsequences

[LC792](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences/)

Note:
We need to be careful about what kinds of input we may get
* Given words might contains a lot of repeating words
* Given string s might be very long

Not really focusing on any algorithm or structure.

The idea is to:
1. convert the 2D Grid into 1D array
2. Make the shift k % (row * col)
3. Convert 1D array back to 2D Grid

```python
class Solution:
    def numMatchingSubseq(self, s: str, words: List[str]) -> int:
        word_counts = Counter(words)
        total_count = 0
        for word, count in word_counts.items():
            i, match = 0, True
            if len(word) > len(s):
                # not a subsequence
                continue
            for letter in word:
                # if doesn't find, return -1
                i = s.find(letter, i) + 1
                if i == 0:
                    match = False
                    break
            if match:
                total_count += count
        return total_count
```

### Complexity
- length of `s` is n
- number of `words` is m
- length of longest `word` is k

Note: In python `len()` function has O(1) time complexity

- Time Complexity: O(m * k * n)
- Space Complexity: O(m)
